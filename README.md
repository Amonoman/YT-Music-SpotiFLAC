# YT‑Music‑SpotiFLAC

<img src="icon-proj.png" width="128" />

A compact, high‑performance [SpotiFLAC](https://github.com/zarzet/SpotiFLAC-Mobile) extension that integrates YouTube Music as a metadata and search source.  
It provides reliable search results, robust metadata matching, and operates strictly as a metadata‑only provider so [SpotiFLAC](https://github.com/zarzet/SpotiFLAC-Mobile) can use other providers for downloads.
